This was an attempt to read the message off the Perseverance rover parachute.


The first pass didn't work, but it was fun and I learned a lot about image processing.
I could probably have made better progress by hand (and with a better image) but whatever. I had a good time.

I've updated this to do apply a bunch of bit transformations to the (good) data I got from https://pastebin.com/13CyyWjj.

you don't need to install anything unless you want to mess with the image manipulations.

run: `./bin/process`
